# Isomorphic Bubble Sort Algorithm in TypeScript
Sorts different data structures with a single piece of reusable code.

## Sortable data structures
1. **Array of numbers**
2. **String of characters**
3. **Single linked list**

## Why is it awesome?
1. Uses TypeScript
2. Uses abstract classes & inheritance to establish class contracts
3. Sorting logic was written only once for an array of numbers, and then other data structures just had to implement the contractual methods.

## Getting started
1. **Install**
```shell
    npm install

```
2. **Run and develop**
```shell
    npm start

```
